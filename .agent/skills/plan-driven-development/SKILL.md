# Plan-Driven Development

Turn the user's maintained plan into bounded, traceable work. Keep intent, implementation facts, and verification results distinct. Adapt existing repository conventions.

## Select the workflow

- **Initialize:** extract a structured model, resolve prerequisites, and generate the requested skeleton and task documents from the supplied plan.
- **Update:** reconcile explicit plan changes and current implementation with prior versions; preserve history and refresh affected artifacts.
- **Implement:** compile a self-contained task bundle, perform the work, verify affected criteria, and record the outcome.
- **Verify:** map requirements to symbols and behavior, inspect evidence, and determine whether the scoped task can advance.

Read [references/project-model.md](references/project-model.md) for the model, artifacts, and lifecycle. Read [references/verification.md](references/verification.md) for logic analysis, comments, complexity, scoring, and evidence. Read [references/task-status.md](references/task-status.md) before creating or updating a visible task index. Use [assets/project.example.json](assets/project.example.json) as a small worked model and [assets/evidence.example.json](assets/evidence.example.json) as a pending report. When the accepted baseline has no equivalent templates, adapt [assets/task-index.template.md](assets/task-index.template.md), [assets/task.template.md](assets/task.template.md), and [assets/implementation.template.md](assets/implementation.template.md); never replace richer baseline templates with these generic ones. Do not copy example-specific product choices into unrelated projects.

When the user identifies an existing repository, previous project, template, or workflow as accepted, read [references/preservation.md](references/preservation.md) before initializing or restructuring anything. Treat that source as a compatibility baseline, not merely inspiration.

## Preserve accepted approaches

- Inventory the baseline's document roles, paths, IDs, authority order, status views, task-to-implementation-to-evidence links, agent workflows, and supersession behavior before proposing a replacement.
- Preserve accepted structures and semantics by default. Improvements are additive unless the user explicitly approves removal, semantic replacement, or an authority change.
- Classify each affected baseline element as `preserve`, `enhance`, `supersede`, or `remove`. Record approval and replacements for `supersede` or `remove`; never infer approval from a request to improve the system.
- Preserve historical implementation records and evidence. A task may be execution-complete and later superseded; track execution state separately from current relevance.
- Retain human-readable requirement, technical, task, status, and implementation layers when the baseline uses them. A machine-readable model and generated bundles supplement those layers instead of collapsing them into summaries.
- Detect and repair drift inside the preserved structure, such as stale counts, broken links, contradictory statuses, or obsolete indexes. Drift is not permission to discard the structure.

## Preserve working preferences

- Use English for engineering artifacts; derive product languages and stack choices from the plan.
- Preserve existing requirement, invariant, decision, and task IDs; link supersessions rather than renumbering or deleting history.
- Keep comments minimal. Explain only complex or non-obvious logic remaining after refactoring: the reason, invariant, or constraint.
- Bound tasks with explicit acceptance criteria, dependencies, inputs, outputs, exclusions, and evidence. Use five estimated hours as a provisional splitting guideline when no project rule exists; document exceptions rather than inventing estimates.
- Give interface/schema changes explicit tasks and compatibility or migration plans. Avoid treating every file as frozen.
- Keep relevant global invariants and project fallback gates visible in task context.

## Assign one authority per fact

| Fact | Authority |
|---|---|
| Goals, scope, intended behavior, invariants, decisions | Maintained plan and accepted amendments |
| Structured requirement/task definitions | Validated model compiled from that intent |
| Task state, blockers, completion history | Execution records |
| Implemented behavior | Inspected code and observed execution |
| Outcomes and calibrated confidence | Evidence tied to exact input revisions |
| Maps, indexes, summaries, agent adapters | Generated views of the authorities above |

For a new project, default to `project.yaml`; JSON is also supported. For an accepted baseline, declare whether the model is authored or generated and preserve the baseline's established authority. Do not maintain two independently writable specifications. Keep execution state separately under `.project/`, while rendering the baseline's existing human-readable status view when it has one. A generated progress region in the plan may reflect state without rewriting intent.

## Initialize and maintain

1. Read the supplied plan, applicable `AGENTS.md`, existing task/architecture conventions, accepted reference projects, and relevant working-tree changes. Do not assume mentioned external files are accessible. If a required baseline is inaccessible, stop before designing a replacement and request the source.
2. Extract requirements, components, contracts, decisions, risks, gates, tasks, and criteria with source file/section references. Mark inferred and unresolved information. Translate prose into explicit logic obligations independently of current code.
3. Create or refresh the preservation baseline and classify proposed structural changes. Validate IDs, references, dependency cycles, acceptance coverage, scope, required artifacts, and protected conventions. Use authorized defaults and ordinary implementation judgment. Block only work depending on a genuinely unresolved choice or unapproved compatibility break.
4. Generate or update appropriate artifacts without reducing accepted detail: shared `.agent/` instructions and thin tool adapters; architecture/API contracts; requirements; detailed task specifications; three-marker status/dependency indexes; technical notes; implementation-record templates; bundles; evidence locations; selected stack scaffold and real CI configuration when requested. Verify commands exist; keep unimplemented checks pending.
5. Record generated-file ownership, managed regions, template versions, and input/output hashes. Reconcile edited generated regions; preserve human sections, source code, state, and historical evidence.
6. On plan, code, dependency, analyzer, or policy changes, calculate affected dependencies and consumers. Mark dependent evidence stale and tasks needing revalidation. If impact is uncertain, invalidate conservatively.
7. Regenerate indexes and progress summaries from records. Never silently change requirements, tests, or thresholds to make implementation pass.

Build task specifications and bundles with objectives, exclusions, requirement/criterion IDs, dependencies and state, exact inputs and outputs, files or symbols, global invariants, relevant contracts, authorized decisions, verification commands, evidence outputs, stop conditions, and the current snapshot. Preserve the baseline's one-task-per-file and completion-record conventions when present. Avoid requiring agents to rediscover the document graph.

Render each task in the visible index with exactly one generated marker: `[]` for `todo` or `ready`, `[!]` for `in_progress`, `verifying`, `blocked`, or `needs_revalidation`, and `[x]` for `done`. Require detail for `[!]` and current evidence for `[x]`. Keep relevance separate, so a completed task later marked `superseded` remains `[x]`. Never hand-edit a marker independently of its execution record.

## Verify before advancement

Follow `references/verification.md`: use NLP for contracts and mappings, AST-derived control/data flow for behavior, and independently defined behavioral evidence. Similarity or a model's self-rating is insufficient.

Use `pass`, `fail`, or `inconclusive`. Confirmed violations fail. Missing, stale, unsupported, or uncalibrated required evidence is inconclusive. Only pass permits automatic completion and dependent-task advancement. Diagnosis, repair, and unrelated work may continue.

Never invent calibrated confidence. Represent unavailable scores as `null` with a reason. Calibration must apply to the actual language, requirement kind, evaluator versions, and scope. Keep manual decisions distinct from automated confidence. Record an explicitly authorized completion-policy change as a policy change, not as measured success.

Use concise completion records for routine work and full implementation notes for critical invariants, contracts, trust boundaries, or release gates. Include deviations and gaps. Preserve machine-generated results from actual runs, including failures.

Apply calibrated logic gates to tasks making code-behavior claims. For documentation, configuration, and scaffold work, use the applicable structural, build, or manual criteria without claiming domain-logic verification. Do not block a documentation update on a nonexistent behavioral calibration model.

## Bundled helper

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/check_project.py validate project.yaml
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/check_project.py audit-preservation project.yaml --root .
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/check_project.py audit-task-status docs/task/README.md
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/check_project.py gate project.yaml .project/evidence/T-007.json --task T-007 --source-hash <current-source-snapshot-sha256>
```

The helper validates structure and report metadata. `audit-preservation` checks that declared `preserve` and `enhance` artifact paths still exist after generation; it cannot judge semantic equivalence or user approval. `audit-task-status` checks the visible marker, detailed execution state, relevance, attention detail, completion evidence, and duplicate IDs. Its gate is for automatic logic-verification decisions, not ordinary manual/document completion. It does not interpret prose, analyze ASTs, run tests, establish calibration, or authenticate artifacts. Inspect real runner outputs before trusting reports. The current source hash must come from the runner's complete input manifest, including uncommitted files and transitive dependencies; a commit ID alone is insufficient for a dirty tree.

Exit codes: `0` valid/pass, `1` invalid/fail, `2` inconclusive/unusable input. YAML needs PyYAML; JSON uses the standard library. Report unavailable analyzers instead of claiming success.

## Scope and delivery

Maintain alignment during requested work and task/plan updates. The skill does not create a background service or scheduled task. Configure ongoing automation only when requested. Skill installation does not authorize deployments, publication, purchases, or messages to others.

Report what changed, what was actually checked, which tasks can advance, and specific remaining blockers. Do not claim universal program correctness.
